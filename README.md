# Experience vs Salary Classification

This project demonstrates a simple example of using logistic regression to classify salary levels based on work experience. The dataset consists of experience (in years) and salary (in currency units). We convert this regression problem into a classification problem by setting a threshold on the salary, and then we predict whether a given experience leads to a "high salary" or "low salary".

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a simple, manually created set:

| Experience (years) | Salary |
|--------------------|--------|
| 1                  | 35000  |
| 2                  | 40000  |
| 3                  | 45000  |
| 4                  | 50000  |
| 5                  | 55000  |

### Binary Classification

- **High Salary**: Salary â‰¥ 45000 is classified as `1`.
- **Low Salary**: Salary < 45000 is classified as `0`.
